	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>Hello, my name is Mitchell Porter. I'm a 21-year-old who is a junior at BYUI, majoring in software engineering and minoring in data science. I love programming, but I don't have much of an artistic eye for design. My hobbies are mostly made of basketball, video games and going outside, but I'll do just about anything with good company, I like to try to diversify my interests when an opportunity arises.</p>
